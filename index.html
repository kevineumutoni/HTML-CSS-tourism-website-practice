            My dream destination is South Korea because I was attracted to their beautiful country and people!
             I mean both their heart and beauty is top notch! Firstly South Korea is a peaceful country compared
              to North Korea. Secondly It is a developed country with many attractive cultures.
               It's where the SAMSUNG company is based, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thv/?hl=en">V from BTS </a> is the ambassador.  
               They are rich in their entertainment industry where they have the top tier K-pop and K-drama industry.
            The first time I learned about South Korea was in 2020 during Covid-19 period. We got our movie from a cyber,
             and he gave us a movie called “Innocent man” by Song Joong Ki, I was amazed to see how humble, beautiful everything was, 
             then we went to Lee Min Ho , It was a perfect human being to see, as in it was very nice to see how clean their movies are,
              only the beauty of the first and second actors are enough to love the whole movie. If I make it in life I will take a tour to South Korea and explore by myself.
